# Gaia-density-proper_motion-maps

This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for the visualization of the sky density of sources, and proper motions in the sky in Gaia EDR3 that were produced as part of the release day outreach efforts. 

AllSkyDensityMap.ipynb by Andre Moitinho

AllSkyProperMotionMap.ipynb is an adaptation of the original code from Anthony G.A. Brown, Leiden University, at https://github.com/agabrown/gaiaedr3-proper-motion-visualizations.
Modifications by A. Moitinho, University of Lisbon.: minor fixes of code broken by recent versions (2024) of cartopy and astropy.coordinates
